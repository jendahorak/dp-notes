# WebGL 3D Graphics Explained in 100 Seconds

JS API 
- hardware accelerated graphics in the browser - v html cnavas
- google  maps, unity - web based games


# 3D theory and rendering pipeline 
[[@IntroModernOpenGL - An intro to modern OpenGL. Chapter 1_ The Graphics Pipeline]]
Every point is a vertex  - that makes triangles that are primitives - light - rasterization into projection of 2D pixel

Customisation of this pipeline by writing shaders - funtions that tell computer how not write pixels on the screen. - linear algebra nad matrix multiplication

WebGL makes it possible to do this operations on GPU. Based on OpenGL 
Shaders are written in GLSL - which is hard

# Libs
## Three.js
- library for drawing 3D in browser
