# What is mixed reality? - Mixed Reality
Next wave of computing 
Today most popular mixed reality is - mobile filters 
Blend of physical and digital worlds - human, computer and enviromental 3D interactions
Based on **computer vision** ,**graphical processing**, display tech. input system and cloud computing.  

Mixed reality first introduced  in [[@milgramTaxonomyMixedReality1994]] - koncept of virtuality continuum 
Since then mixed reality got:
- enviromental understanding: spatial mapping and anchors
- human understanding: hand-tracking, eye-tracking, speech

- location and positioning in both physical and virtual spaces
- colaboration 3D assets in mixed reality
