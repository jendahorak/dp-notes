# APIs for Beginners - How to use an API (Full Course / Tutorial)
# Remote APIs
- REST won - representational state transfer
- there are others - graphQL atd. 

- Client -> URI -> Server
	- thru HTTP protocol - (how to comunicate)
		- GET
		- RESPONSE - HTML
		- originaly stateless
			- if we want state client does have to process it itself
		- POST - submit data to server
How to past information after request - after ? in URL. Anther common way is HTTP headers (kv pair of information) - allows for caching. RESPONSE also has header - response codes 

## What it means to be RESTful
Client makes request to server - http (stateless) - 
Almost everything can be abstracted to **resource** and **collection**. 
Almost everything we want to do to those **resources** can be explained by **CRUD**. (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE). We can represent CRUD by using HTTP Verbs.
