# Virtual Reality

Four key components of VR definition
1. Targeted behavior - organism is having an experience that was designed by the creator 
2. Organism - whoever - 
3. Artificial sensory stimulation - one or more senses is hijacked partialy by replaced inputs of artificial stimuli
4. Awareness - organism is unaware of the interference "fooled" into feeling present in a virtual world - sense of *presence* and it is accepted as being natural
