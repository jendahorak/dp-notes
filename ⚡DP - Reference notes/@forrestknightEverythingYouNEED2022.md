## Peer to peer architecture
- blockchain tech - Web3
- nodes that can comunicate between each other - without one central


## Monolithic 
- one codebase
- everything in one place
- not scalable, not relaiable, everything needs to be redeployed

## Microservice architecture
- modular 
- everything is on different machine and worked on by different team
- redeploying only one "service"
- very scalable

## Serverless architecture - FAAS
- break down services into individual event driven functions 

Just granularizing
