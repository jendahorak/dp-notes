# Why I Use NextJS For ALL My Backends


# What does backend framework do
- runs code noa  cpu that the user does not own
- presrcibes a method for making a fulfiling requests to servers

# How does NEXT differ from React
- It can run on a server (SSR, SSG, ISR)
- Allows to build API endpoints for sending and receiving non-HTML things
- It has a pages/ dir for creating new HTML routes in React - making and fullfiling requests for servers
- its backend for React

# When do I need a backend
- need to get data to user that user doesnt have
- you need to aurhorize user
- you need to share data the user has with other users
- you need to persist anything


# How
- /api dir 
- you add a file and you have an endpoint


# Why not Next.js as a backend
